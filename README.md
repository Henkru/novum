# Novum - rev1

The split keyboard for me (it may not be for you).

## Background

I began my split keyboard journey with the [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58),
and I've been enjoying it. However, the offset of specific columns wasn't optimal
for my hands, and I couldn't comfortably reach certain keys in the thumb fan.
The [Sofle](https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/) solved some of these
issues, but I decided to create my own split keyboard designed specifically for
my hands.

As part of using the Lily58, I found out:

* I didn't use the "extra" key next to G and H.
* The top left and right keys are too far away to reach.
* Swapping Ctrl and Shift keys in the default layout didn't work for me.

The following split keyboards inspire Novum:

* [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58)
* [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard)
* [Fortitude60](https://github.com/Pekaso/fortitude60)
* [pteron](https://github.com/FSund/pteron-keyboard)

### Design Principles

* Columns located perfectly for my fingers.
* Keep it simple and stupid:
  * No RGB nonsense
  * No display
  * No wireless
* The thumb fan is curved perfectly for my thumb, and the keys are not located under
the hand.
* Built with [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen), inspired by
[corney-island](https://github.com/ceoloide/corney-island/tree/main) and
[spleeb](https://github.com/chrishoage/spleeb/tree/main).
* Individual PCBs for the left and right sides. My OCD does not like the
reversible PCBs.

## Generate PCBs

You can find the pre-generated files on the [Releases](https://github.com/Henkru/novum/releases)
page. However, if you want, you can generate the files yourself by executing the
`build.sh` script (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com)).

The build process consists of multiple phases:

1. Generate the unrouted PCBs.
2. Inject the JLCPCB [design rules](https://github.com/labtroll/KiCad-DesignRules).
3. Import hand-routed tracks into PCBs.
4. [Autoroute](https://freerouting.org) the unconnected items.
5. Use [KiBot](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot) to generate gerbers and images.

Each step is located in the `builder/steps` folder. Hand-routed tracks
can be extracted from the `.kicad_pcb` files by executing `npm run export-tracks`.

## Different PCBs

The  revision 1 is a typical sandwich design, with each layer intended to be a
1.6 mm thick FR-4 circuit board. This approach reduces costs and streamlines
manufacturing, as it allows all boards to be ordered from a single supplier.

The current design offers three variants for the bottom board. The *standard*
version features intricate PCB art on exposed copper layers and requires an
[ENIG](https://jlcpcb.com/blog/203-choosing-the-right-surface-finish-for-your-pcb/?from=BWBS)
(Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold) surface finish. If this design feels too
elaborate, a blank bottom board is also included in the release package as an
alternative. Additionally, the package contains a bottom board compatible with
splitkb's [tenting puck](https://splitkb.com/products/tenting-puck) accessary,
providing further customization options.

## Firmware

Any [RP2040 Community Edition](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/platformdev_rp2040.md)
standard boards should. However, the keyboard is only tested with [Liatris](https://splitkb.com/products/liatris)
and [SparkFun Pro Micro - RP2040](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18288) boards.
The following firmware is currently supported, and the pre-build binaries can
be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/Henkru/novum/releases) page.

* [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)
* [Vial](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk)

Currently, the keyboard has yet to be merged into the above mainline repos.
